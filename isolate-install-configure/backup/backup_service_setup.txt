# Run these commands in a user called ansible home folder

# Step 1
# Copy backup.sh and clear-zip.sh files to /home/ansible folder and run:
chmod +x backup.sh clear-zip.sh

# Step 2
# Copy backup.service and backup.timer files to /etc/systemd/system folder and run:
sudo systemctl enable backup.timer
sudo systemctl start backup.timer

# Step 3
# Check the status of backup.timer to make sure the next run will be in 5 minutes

# - Network must be up and running
# --- IP address should be available
# - ansible user's public/private key pair should be in ~/.ssh/ folder
# --- id_rsa.pub and id_rsa SHOULD be the name of these files
